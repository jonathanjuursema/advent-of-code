# Advent of Code
This is a repository which contains my personal puzzle solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

My goal for these puzzles is to write readable code. I'm forgoing optimizations if they're making the code less readable, or if I've been spending too much time on a particular puzzle. ðŸ˜… On the other hand, I do sometimes use shorthand or method chaining, but in that case I aim to make the goal clear (with clear variable names or comments).

Where I have been unable to solve a puzzle myself and used hints from the [sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) or code snippts from sites like StackOverflow, I'm crediting this. If I copied your code but somehow I forgot to credit, please message me and I'll correct it.

These answers are nowhere near a walkthrough or optimal solutions. I'm putting them out there for others to use if they are stuck.

Merry puzzle solving and happy holidays!
